Question 1:
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Answer 1:
Git creates the necessary tracking files and folders for the commits. Without these files, Git does not know what files and folders are under version control.

Question 2:
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Answer 2:
Staging area is a temporary save that will become the commit. The staging area allows the selection of specific files to be added to commit to allow for one logical change to occur.
