Question 1:
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Answer 1:
Using a remote repository is useful for collaborating with other contributors. Additionally, if working on multiple computers, such as a desktop and a laptop. The remote repository is also useful to act as a backup in the case of a dead hard drive.
